# MLoMCFinalProject
Final Project of the Machine Learning on Microcontrollers Course. Implemented a keyword detector on the STM32L475 microcontroller with the B-L475E-IOT01A1 development board using machine learning and the "Hey Snips" dataset (Coucke A. et al., "Efficient keyword spotting using dilated convolutions and gating") as well as self generated data.
